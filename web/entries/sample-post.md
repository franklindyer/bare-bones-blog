This is just a sample entry showing off some stuff you can do in a markdown post.

Here's a bulleted list:

- apple
- banana
- pear
- peach
- pineapple
- tomato
- sausage

Here's a block of code:

<code><pre>
def fibo(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
</pre></code>
